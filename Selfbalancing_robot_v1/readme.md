## How it works

#### This self balancing robot start at a give intial speed to begin movement. If the reading from the MPU_60 is less than or greater than the initalangle(Threshold) the initalspeed would be adjusted to maintain balance

## Electronics needed

### 2 DC motor

### One MPU_60

### 5 volt (HI-WATT)

### Arduino Nano

#### Shop electronics from Nigeria at 360 hub

#### Shop electronics from Anywhere at Amazon

## Disadvantages

#### Self balancing robot tend to move in an ackward way but still maintain balance.
