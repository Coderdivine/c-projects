## How it works

#### This self balancing robot start at a give intial speed to begin movement. If the reading from the MPU_60 is less than or greater than the initalangle(Threshold) the initalspeed would be adjusted to maintain balance

## Electronics needed

### 2 DC motor

### One MPU_60

### 5 volt (HI-WATT)

### Arduino Nano
