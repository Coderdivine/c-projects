## How it works

#### This self balancing robot start at a given initial speed to begin movement. If the reading from the MPU_60 is less than or greater than the initial angle(Threshold) the initialspeed would be adjusted to maintain balance

## Electronics needed

### 2 DC motor

### One MPU_6050

### 5 volt (HI-WATT)

### Arduino Nano

#### Shop electronics from Nigeria on 360 hub

#### Shop electronics from Anywhere on Amazon

## Disadvantages

#### Self balancing robot tend to move in an ackward way but still maintain balance.
